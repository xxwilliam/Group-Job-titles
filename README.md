  <p><b>Group Job Titles:</b></p>

<p>All four people in our group have different interests and different career paths. The job titles for our group’s ideal jobs are as following.

<p>&#9733; Cyber Security Specialist <b>(William Hansen)</b></p>
<p>&#9733; Cyber Forensics Specialist <b>(Madiha Sabahat)</b></p>
<p>&#9733; IT Support Officer <b>(Alexander Ball)</b></p>
<p>&#9733; Desktop Support <b>(Samantha Kurilic)</b></p>
 
<p>In our group Cyber Security specialist is the top ranked job in demand from employers. According to this blog ( https://blog.y-axis.com/which-occupations-are-in-demand-in-australia-in-2021/) ICT security specialists rank 20 overall in Australia in demand from employers this year. In the past few years we have seen and heard about numerous global cyber-attacks, credit card thefts, and sensitive information leaked. These incidents have sparked an interest among organizations in hiring more ICT security specialists, so that they could protect their organizations from cyber-attacks.
IT support Officers are always in demand as well. Different organizations and industries including public administration, information technology, insurance, finance and retail trade hire them. IT Support Officers are always in demand but in current times the demand for this job has increased even more because they are crucial for business. According to an article published in technojobs.co.uk, IT support officers ranked number 2 in demand from employers in 2020. <b>(https://www.technojobs.co.uk/info/career-advice/10-most-in-demand-it-jobs-for-2020.phtml)</b>
Desktop support ranks 3rd in our group’s jobs ranking in demand from employers but the demand for Desktop support technicians is anticipated to increase by 10% in the coming years and this is more than any other occupation. In the past two years during the pandemic Desk Help was the second fastest growing job according to an article published by Joseph Tsidulko in CRN.
Cyber Security jobs are very in demand, that includes Cyber forensics Specialist as well. According to a study done by ECU Cyber Forensics ranked 10th in Cyber security jobs. This job has more to do with Criminal law and Forensics Science. Jobs in cyber security are projected to be stronger in coming years, the demand of cyber forensic professionals have also gradually increased but it still ranks lower than other jobs in our group.</p>

Opinion on Ideal Jobs:
<p><b>For William Hansen,</b> his opinion on his ideal job (Cyber security specialist) has changed for a few reasons. First because of his age, he thinks that after looking at the data he realized that it will take a lot of time to complete a number of qualifications to get this job and secondly, it’s a difficult industry and hard to get a job at any age.</p>
<p><b>Alexander Ball’s</b> Opinion about his ideal job (IT support Officer) has not changed because he enjoys working in customer facing roles and he is eager to learn more skills. He thinks that his ideal job might change over the coming years but for now this is the best start.</p>
<p>Burning glass data has definitely changed <b>Samantha Kurilic’s</b> perspective on the greater need for her ideal job (Desktop support). Looking at this data, it has encouraged her to add more skills that are in demand to her experience and she believes it will give her greater opportunity for future positions and it will broaden the employment search and demand for her.</p>
<p><B> Madiha Sabahat’s</b> opinion has changed about the skills needed for the job. It's a constant learning field. Apart from having a degree a lot of skills are required, which need specific certificates to be completed. She thinks that before researching or looking at Burning glass data she didn’t realize the amount of IT specific skills or general skills required. It has motivated her to work hard to acquire the skills needed for her ideal job.</p>
